## Compatibility

Tested on Firefox 36, Chrome 41 and IE 10+.

IE9 is partially supported because it doesn't fire input event on text deletion as the spec says. IE8- are not supported since they don't conform to DOM level 3 anyway.

## Features

1. Case-insensitive keyword filtering for data rows (matching keyword will be highlighted yellow).
2. Sort by column values.
